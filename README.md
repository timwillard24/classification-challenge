#Spam Detector
This project is focused on detecting spam using a machine learning approach. The dataset includes features such as word frequency, character frequency, and capital letter statistics to classify messages as spam or not spam.

## Project Structure
spam_detector.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis and model building process for spam detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains several features, including:
- Word Frequency: Frequency of specific words like make, address, etc.
- Character Frequency: Frequency of specific characters like ;, $, etc.
- Capital Letter Measures: Metrics related to the use of capital letters, such as capital_run_length_average.

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have Python installed along with the following packages:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the spam_detector.ipynb notebook.
3. Run the cells to load the data, preprocess it, and train the model.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the provided metrics.
